# DynamicArray

A Solidity Library for managing dynamic array of primitive types.

⚠️ Dynamic array of type `bytes32` (`Bytes32Array`), `address` (`AddressArray`) and `uint256` (`UintArray`) are supported.

## Roadmap

1. Initial Implementation (✅)
2. TypeScript
3. Improve `shrink`
   - Confirm: modifying `length` of dynamic array on storage will/won't erase stale area?
   - Gas costly cheap?
4. Use Assembly
   - Bounding check is accomplished by accessing array element by default. It's safe without it. Use low-level Assembly to skip it.
5. Support types narrower than 32 bytes
   - The architecture is not gas costly effetive for primitive types smaller than 16 bytes. Any idea? 🙄

## Description

The goal is to build a dynamically sized array similar to [C++ std::vector](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector). Storage space is expensive on Ethereum; therefore, it is important to delete items when possible.

Write a Solidity library that implements “DynamicArray” with the following methods. You’ll have to fix the signatures to use the appropriate types and modifiers in Solidity. 
- `set(array, position, value)`: overwrite position in array with value
- `get(array, position)`: return value at position in array. Exception if position is out of bounds.
- `push(array, value)`: add value to end of array, increase array size
- `pop(array)`: remove and return value at end of array, decrease array size
- `size(array)`: return the current size of array
- `capacity(array)`: return the total storage size of array
- `clear(array)`: set size of array to 0
- `shrink(array)`: delete items from array until size == capacity. This is the only time data is deleted.

For example, if you push 10 values, then size == 10 and capacity == 10. If you pop 5 values, then size == 5, capacity == 10. If you try to get(array, 7) then that should raise an error because 7 exceeds the size, even though it is within the capacity.

For inspiration, take a look at [`EnumerableMap`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/structs/EnumerableMap.sol) and [`EnumerableSet`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/structs/EnumerableSet.sol) from OpenZeppelin. Notice they use bytes32 as the underlying storage type, but expose type-specific functions for uint256 and address.

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "../DynamicArray.sol";

contract AddressBook {
  using DynamicArray for DynamicArray.AddressArray;

  DynamicArray.AddressArray private book;

  function addAddress(address account) external {
    book.push(account);
  }

  function getAddressAt(uint256 index) external view returns (address) {
    return book.get(index);
  }

  function replaceAddressAt(uint256 index, address account) external {
    book.set(index, account);
  }

  function removeAddressAtLast() external returns (address) {
    return book.pop();
  }

  function numberOfAddresses() external view returns (uint256) {
    return book.size();
  }

  function sizeOfBook() external view returns (uint256) {
    return book.capacity();
  }

  function clearBook() external {
    book.clear();
  }

  function deleteBook() external {
    book.clear();
    book.shrink();
  }
}
